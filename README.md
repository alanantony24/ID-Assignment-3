# Problem Statement
Nowadays,many youths,students and working adults are busy round the clock,and are very committed to their responsibilities.However,one common issue many people face is time management,caused by lack of planning and a lack of motivation.Hence,my teammate and I decided to come up with a website called orDino,which allows users to plan their schedule and organise their day-to-day events whilst leading stress-free lives. Not motivated or fascinated?? Fret not,this app will offer gamifying features for users to get going.
